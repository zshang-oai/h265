[HEVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) video and
[HEIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format) image codec in pure Go,
decoding and encoding. No CGo, no dependencies.

The decoder is byte-exact on the JCT-VC HEVC v1 conformance suite. What the encoder writes is
held to libde265, FFmpeg and libheif sample for sample.

SIMD support for amd64 (AVX2, AVX-512), arm64 (NEON) and riscv64 (RVV, with `GORISCV64=rva23u64`).
Build with `-tags noasm` for pure Go everywhere.

### Decoding

```go
img, err := heic.Decode(r)
```

`heic.Decode` returns `*image.NRGBA`, or `*image.NRGBA64` above 8 bits, and registers itself with
`image.RegisterFormat`. The `hevc` package decodes the bitstream on its own, a NAL unit at a time:

```go
d := hevc.Decoder{}

for _, nal := range nals {
    nal.Tag = tag // Optional timestamp or frame ID; the first slice supplies it.
    pics, err := d.DecodeNAL(nal)
    for _, pic := range pics {
        // Consume pic's visible planes and pic.Tag, then release its storage.
        pic.Release()
    }
    // Handle err after consuming any completed pictures returned alongside it.
    ...
}
```

Each call accepts one complete NAL; slices of a picture may arrive in separate
calls. The final slice finishes reconstruction and filtering without waiting for
the next picture. With zero SPS reorder depth, that picture is returned immediately;
otherwise output follows the stream's ordering constraints. Each picture retains
the first slice's opaque `Tag`, including zero, through any output reordering.
Use `SplitAnnexB` or `SplitHVCC` to frame complete input into NAL units.

Use `Flush` at end of stream, not after each frame. `Reset` discards pending output,
references and parameter sets while preserving configured limits; already returned
pictures remain valid until `Release`. Decode errors also reset the decoder.
`Picture.Corrupt` warns when an active reference list contains an unavailable or
previously damaged picture, allowing the application to request recovery without
treating every synthesized reference as a syntax error. Like FFmpeg's per-frame
corruption flag, it reports potentially damaged output, not a fatal decode error.
The warning is conservative: it does not identify damaged pixels, and a false
value is not a guarantee that every kind of bitstream damage has been detected.

Set `FrameSizeLimit` and `Threads` to the application's decoded-size and worker
budgets, and limit compressed input before parsing it. Picture planes are read-only;
decoder operations and picture releases must be serialized.

### Encoding

`heic.Encode` writes any image as a HEIC still, keeping alpha as the auxiliary item of
ISO/IEC 23008-12 Annex F.

```go
err := heic.Encode(w, img, heic.EncodeOptions{Quality: 60})
```

`hevc.Encoder` writes the bitstream on its own, as self-contained intra IDR access units:

```go
enc, err := hevc.NewEncoder(hevc.EncoderOptions{Width: 1920, Height: 1080, QP: 26})
nals, err := enc.Encode(hevc.Frame{
    Y: y, Cb: cb, Cr: cr,
    StrideY: yStride, StrideC: cStride,
})
stream := hevc.MarshalAnnexB(nals)
```

### Supported

Decoding: 8-16 bit, 4:2:0/4:2:2/4:4:4/monochrome, tiles, wavefronts, dependent slice segments,
PCM, lossless, scaling lists, and the range extensions other than cross-component prediction,
RDPCM and CABAC bypass alignment, which are refused rather than decoded wrongly. In the container
alpha, `grid`, `clap`/`irot`/`imir`, `colr`, image sequences, Exif and XMP.

Encoding: 8-12 bit, 4:2:0/4:2:2/4:4:4/monochrome, intra only, deblocking, sample adaptive
offset, wavefronts, PCM lossless, and alpha, `grid`, `colr`, Exif and XMP in the container. A picture too large for
any HEVC level is written as a grid of tiles.

Decoding is threaded over grid tiles and wavefront rows; `heic.Options.Threads` and
`hevc.Decoder.Threads` bound it.
